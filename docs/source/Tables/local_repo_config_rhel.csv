Parameter,Details
"**user_repo_url**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable accepts the repository urls of the user which contains the packages required for the cluster.

* When ``repo_config`` is always, the given list will be configured on the OIM and packages required for cluster will be downloaded into a local repository.

* When ``repo_config`` is never, no local repository is created and packages are downloaded on all cluster nodes.

* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository.

* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted then   gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository.

* **Sample value**: ``- {url: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/"",gpgkey: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY""}``"
"**rhel_os_url**

``string``

Required","* Mandatory when ``cluster_os_type`` is ``rhel`` in ``input/project_default/software_config.json``.
* User has to provide the code ready builder url in order to download the packages.
* When ``repo_config`` is ""always"", the given ``rhel_os_url`` will be configured in the OIM and packages required for cluster will be downloaded.
* When repo_config is ""never"", the packages required for cluster coming from ``rhel_repo_url`` will not be downloaded.
* The ``rhel_os_url`` is configured via proxy in compute nodes.

* **Example**: If ``cluster_os_type`` is rhel, ``rhel_os_url`` might be ""- {url: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/"", gpgkey: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY""}""

.. caution:: Omnia does not support adding a Red Hat subscription URL to the ``rhel_os_url`` parameter. Adding it results in an error during ``local_repo_utility.yml`` playbook execution. For more information, `click here <../../../Troubleshooting/KnownIssues/RHEL/local_repo.html>`_."
"**omnia_repo_url_rhel**

``JSON List``

Required","* A list of all the repo urls from where ``.rpm`` packages will be downloaded for RHEL clusters.
* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository where the package is hosted.
* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted, then gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository.
* 'name' defines the name of the software ``.rpm`` package.
* These inputs are not validated by Omnia. Incorrect values provided to this variable can lead to unexpected failures during Omnia's deployment.
* Ensure that all URLs listed below are reachable from the OIM.
