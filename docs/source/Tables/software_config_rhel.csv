"**repo_config**

``string``

Required","* When the value is set to ``always`` or ``partial``, Omnia creates a local Pulp repository on the OIM and stores all the packages/images required for the cluster in that repository.
* In case of ""always"", Omnia downloads the all packages from the internet even if you have provided your own repository or registry details via ``user_repo_url`` or ``user_registry`` in ``local_repo_config.yml``.
* In case of ``partial``, Omnia first checks the ``user_repo_url`` or ``user_registry`` and downloads all the packages from the URLs listed there. The packages that are not listed are then downloaded from the internet.
* **Accepted value**: ``always``, ``partial``
* **Default value**: ``always``

.. note:: Repositories that are not available as images, debian packages, or RPMs will be downloaded and configured locally on the OIM.
