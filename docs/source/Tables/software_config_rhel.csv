Parameter,Details
"**cluster_os_type**

``string``

Required","* Specify the operating system running on the OIM and the one to be provisioned on the compute nodes.
* **Value**: ``rhel``"
"**cluster_os_version**

``string``

Required","* The OS Version that will be provisoned on compute nodes.
* For RHEL, the accepted ``value`` is ``9.4``."
"**iso_file_path**

``string``

Required","* Path where the user has placed the ``<OS>.iso`` image that needs to be provisioned on target nodes. 
* ``iso_file_path`` should contain the ``provision_os`` and ``provision_os_version`` values mentioned in the filename.
* **Example**: ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/RHEL-9.4.0-20240419.25-x86_64-dvd1.iso``"
"**repo_config**

``string``

Required","* When the value is set to ``always`` or ``partial``, Omnia creates a local Pulp repository on the OIM and downloads all the packages/images required for the cluster in that repository. 
* In case of ``always``, Omnia downloads all the required packages from the internet when the ``local_repo.yml`` is executed. Once downloaded, these packages are cached for future use.
* In case of ``partial``, during ``local_repo.yml`` playbook execution, Omnia first checks the ``user_repo_url`` or ``user_registry`` and downloads all the packages from the URLs listed there. The packages that are not listed are then downloaded from the internet. But, the packages are not cached, they are discarded afterwards.
* In case of ``never``, Omnia does not store any packages locally. The Pulp container purely acts as a proxy - streaming required packages from the source URLs everytime.
* **Accepted value**: ``always``, ``partial``, ``never``
* **Default value**: ``always``

.. note:: Repositories that are not available as images, debian packages, RPMs, manifests, iso, or tarballs will be downloaded and configured locally on the OIM. Additionally, AMD GPU drivers, CUDA, and OFED are also downloaded by default if they are mentioned in the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/software_config.json``.	"
"**softwares**

``JSON list``

Required","* A JSON list of required software and (optionally) the software version.
* The following software should be listed with a version in the list: BeeGFS, AMD GPU, Kubernetes, CUDA, OFED, UCX, and ROCm.
* A minimum of one software should be provided in the list for ``local_repo.yml`` to execute correctly.
* The ``<os_type>_software_config.json`` will have the basic softwares present in it. To add additional software stacks, add the software under ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/software_config.json``.
* For the list of all applicable softwares based on your ``<cluster_os_type>``, refer the templates at ``examples/template_<os>_software_config.json``. For example, ``examples/template_rhel_software_config.json``.

.. note:: The accepted names for software is taken from ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/config/<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>``.
