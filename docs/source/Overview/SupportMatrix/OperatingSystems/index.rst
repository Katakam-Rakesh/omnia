Operating Systems (OS) Matrix
================================

.. note:: Omnia v1.7 supports both full and minimal OS versions of RHEL/Rocky Linux on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM), and only the minimal version on the cluster nodes (head, compute, and login). For Ubuntu, only the "server install image" is supported on both the OIM and cluster nodes.
