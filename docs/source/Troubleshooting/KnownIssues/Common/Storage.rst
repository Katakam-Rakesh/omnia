⦾ **Why does the task 'nfs_client: Mount NFS client' fail with ``Failed to mount NFS client. Make sure NFS Server is running on IP xx.xx.xx.xx``?**

**Potential Cause**: The required services for NFS may not have been running:

    - nfs
    - rpc-bind
    - mountd

**Resolution**: Enable the required services using ``firewall-cmd  --permanent  --add-service=<service name>`` and then reload the firewall using ``firewall-cmd  --reload``.


⦾ **What to do when omnia.yml execution fails with nfs-server.service might not be running on NFS Server. Please check or start services?**

**Potential Cause**: nfs-server.service is not running on the target node.

**Resolution**: Use the following commands to bring up the service: ::

    systemctl start nfs-server.service

    systemctl enable nfs-server.service


⦾ **Why does the task 'Install Packages' fail on the NFS node with the message: Failure in talking to yum: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64.**

**Potential Cause**: There are connections missing on the NFS node.

**Resolution**: Ensure that there are 3 NICs being used on the NFS node:

1. For provisioning the OS
2. For connecting to the internet (Management purposes)
3. For connecting to PowerVault (Data Connection)


⦾ **What to do if PowerVault throws the error: The specified disk is not available. - Unavailable disk (0.x) in disk range '0.x-x':**

**Resolution**:

1. Verify that the disk in question is not part of any pool using: ``show disks``

2. If the disk is part of a pool, remove it and try again.


⦾ **Why does PowerVault throw the error: You cannot create a linear disk group when a virtual disk group exists on the system.?**

**Potential Cause**: At any given time only one type of disk group can be created on the system. That is, all disk groups on the system have to exclusively be linear or virtual.

**Resolution**: To fix the issue, either delete the existing disk group or change the type of pool you are creating.


⦾ **Why does the task 'nfs_client: Mount NFS client' fail with the message "No route to host"?**

**Potential Cause**: There's a mismatch in the share path listed in ``/etc/exports`` and in ``omnia_config.yml`` under ``nfs_client_params``.

**Resolution**: Ensure that the input paths are a perfect match to avoid any errors.


⦾ **Why is my NFS mount not visible on the client?**

**Potential Cause**: The directory being used by the client as a mount point is already in use by a different NFS export.

**Resolution**: Verify that the directory being used as a mount point is empty by using ``cd <client share path> | ls`` or ``mount | grep <client share path>``. If empty, re-run the playbook.

⦾ **Why does the "BeeGFS-client" service fails?**

**Potential Causes**:

1. SELINUX may be enabled. (use ``sestatus`` to diagnose the issue)

2. Ports 8008, 8003, 8004, 8005 and 8006 may be closed. (use ``systemctl status beegfs-mgmtd, systemctl status beegfs-meta, systemctl status beegfs-storage`` to diagnose the issue)

3. The BeeGFS set up may be incompatible with RHEL.

**Resolutions**:

1. If SELinux is enabled, update the file ``/etc/sysconfig/selinux`` and reboot the server.

2. Open all ports required by BeeGFS: 8008, 8003, 8004, 8005 and 8006

3. Check the `support matrix <../../../Overview/SupportMatrix/OperatingSystems/index.html>`_  to ensure that a supported RHEL OS version is running on the cluster.

4. For further insight into the issue, check out ``/var/log/beegfs-client.log`` on nodes where the BeeGFS client is running.


⦾ **What to do if NFS clients are unable to access the share after an NFS server reboot?**

Reboot the NFS server (external to the cluster) to bring up the services again: ::

    systemctl disable nfs-server
    systemctl enable nfs-server
    systemctl restart nfs-server
