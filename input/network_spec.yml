# This file is used to specify the network configuration.
#
# The variables in this file are divided into two sections: 'admin_network' and 'bmc_network'.
# 'admin_network' is a mandatory field, essential for PXE boot and host communication."
# 'bmc_network' is optional and must be specified only if dynamic bmc discovery is required.
#
# The 'admin_network' section contains the following variables:
# - 'oim_nic_name': The name of the interface on the OIM server associated with the admin network.
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask.
# - 'primary_oim_admin_ip': The admin IP address of the OIM server which is configured.
# - 'static_range': The range of static IP addresses available on the admin network.
# - 'dynamic_range': The range of dynamic IP addresses available on the admin network.
# - 'correlation_to_admin': Whether the OIM server's BMC IP is correlated with the admin IP.
# - 'admin_uncorrelated_node_start_ip': The IP address of the first node when correlation not generated for admin IP from static ranges.
# - 'network_gateway': The gateway IP address of the admin network.
# - 'DNS': The external DNS server IP address for the admin network.
# - 'MTU': Maximum Transmission Unit for the admin network.
#
# The 'bmc_network' section contains the following variables:
# - 'oim_nic_name': The name of the interface on the OIM server associated with the BMC network.
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask.
# - 'dynamic_range': The range of dynamic IP addresses available on the BMC network.
# - 'dynamic_conversion_static_range': The range of static IP addresses that can be converted from dynamic IP addresses on the BMC network.
# - 'reassignment_to_static': Whether the BMC IP addresses are reassigned to static IP addresses.
# - 'network_gateway': The gateway IP address of the BMC network.
# - 'MTU': Maximum Transmission Unit for the BMC network.

# Additional network configurations:
# The following variables are applicable for additional networks:
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask.
# - 'CIDR': Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address and range. If this is provided, 'static_range' is not required.
# - 'static_range': The range of static IP addresses available on the network. If this is provided, 'CIDR' is not required.
# - 'network_gateway': The gateway IP address of the network.
# - 'MTU': Maximum Transmission Unit for the network.
# - 'VLAN': The virtual LAN (VLAN) ID for the network.
#
# NOTE: If vlan creation is required ensure vlan name is provided in the format NIC.vlan_id(eth1.101) in server_spec.yml
